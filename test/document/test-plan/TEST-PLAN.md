# **Test Plan**

## **1. Introduction**
The purpose of this test plan is to ensure that the **Gating System** function correctly according to the specified requirements.

---

## **2. Test Scope**
### **Features to be tested:**
- Backend Invite Code System
- Web3 Gating Mechanism
- Frontend Application

### **Testing Types Covered:**
- Functional Testing
- Security Testing
- Performance & Load Testing
- Usability Testing (for Frontend)

---

## **3. Testing Strategy**

### **3.1. Functional Testing**
- Verify that the API endpoints function correctly.
- Ensure the registration process, invite code validation, and wallet connection work as expected.
- Validate Web3 gating conditions are correctly enforced.

### **3.2. Security Testing**
- Ensure invite codes are difficult to guess and protected against brute-force attacks.
- Verify API security against spam and injection attacks.
- Ensure email uniqueness per invite code.
- Validate Web3 security, ensuring NFT staking cannot be bypassed.

### **3.3. Performance & Load Testing**
- Test API performance under high traffic.
- Validate system stability under concurrent requests.

### **3.4. Usability Testing (Frontend)**
- Ensure UI/UX is user-friendly and intuitive.
- Verify error handling for incorrect user inputs.

---

## **4. Test Environment**
- Backend running on a staging environment with a separate database.
- Web3 testing conducted using a testnet.
- Frontend tested on Chromium based browsers, and Firefox browser.

---

## **9. Defect Tracking**
- Bugs will be logged in **JIRA / GitHub Issues**.
- Bug priority levels:
    - **Critical:** System-breaking issues (e.g., API downtime).
    - **High:** Issues affecting business logic.
    - **Medium:** UI/UX issues not blocking workflow.
    - **Low:** Minor cosmetic or usability defects.

## **10. Risks & Mitigation Strategies**
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Brute-force attacks on invite codes | Security risk | Implement rate-limiting, CAPTCHA |
| System overload | Performance issues | Use caching, scale system |
| Email spam registrations | Data integrity risk | Validate email uniqueness before registration |
